# 3D Shape Abstraction in Python

This project demonstrates the concept of **abstraction** and **polymorphism** in Python using an abstract base class `Shape3D` for 3D shapes.

## Features

- Abstract base class with abstract `surface_area()`  and `volume()` methods.
- Implemented subclasses:
  - `Sphere`
  - `Cylinder`
  - `Cube`
- Random generation of 3D shapes and dimensions.
- Calculation and display of surface area and volume for each shape.

The abstract base class `Shape3D` defines a blueprint for all 3D shapes. It enforces that any subclass must implement:

`surface_area()`

`volume()`

This ensures consistency: no matter what shape we're working withâ€”`Sphere`, `Cylinder`, or `Cube`we know it will have these two methods.
